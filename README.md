## GitLab Development Kit using Docker Compose

This projects aims to ease GitLab Development,
by enabling the use of minimal containers / micro-services
with minimal set of dependencies.

### Features

It currently supports:
- GitLab Rails: Unicorn / Sidekiq,
- GitLab Workhorse,
- Gitaly,
- PostgreSQL,
- Redis,
- SSH,
- GitLab Pages
- GitLab Runner

It allows to:
- Run development environment,
- Run tests,
- Easily teardown and start a new environment.

How it differs from GitLab Development Kit it uses containers for everything,
starting from scratch, building minimal container per application.
Everything has it's own container:
- GitLab Unicorn,
- GitLab Sidekiq,
- GitLab Workhorse,
- Gitaly,
- PostgreSQL,
- Redis,
- Webpacks,
- OpenSSH,
- Container Registry,
- GitLab Pages,
- GitLab Runner,
- Nested Docker Engine (for running CI jobs),

The containers interact via HTTP/TCP using intra-container networking.
There's also a shared volume `/home/git` between: Unicorn, Sidekiq, Workhorse, Gitaly and OpenSSH.

It still doesn't support:
- Geo
- and others...

### Requirements

1. Docker Engine,
2. Docker Compose,
3. GNU Make,
4. Linux machine (it might work on Docker for Mac, but not guaranteed).

### How to use it?

#### 1. Clone:

First clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/ayufan/gitlab-compose-kit.git
```

#### 2. Run to setup:

```bash
$ make create
```

This will take long minutes to build base docker image, compile all dependencies,
provision application.

#### 3. Start the development environment (and keep it running in shell):

```bash
$ make up
```

This will run application in background.

To run it interactively:

```bash
$ make run
```

Then, to reload environment simply Ctrl-C and re-run it again :)

**Access GitLab: http://localhost:3000/**

#### 4. Update

```bash
make update
```

This command will:

1. Pull and merge all sources into current branch,
2. Migrate development and test database.

#### 5. Drop into the shell (for tests)

```bash
$ make shell
$ bin/rspec spec/...
```

### 6. Stop environment

```bash
$ make down
```

This will shutdown all containers, releasing all resources.

### 7. Destroy

```bash
$ make destroy
```

Afterwards you have to run `make setup` again :)

## Pages

To access GitLab Pages you have to use HTTP proxy.
The Pages proxy runs on `http://localhost:8989`.

## Performance

It works great on Linux where the data can be natively shared between filesystems.
However, it is not so great when using Docker for Mac due to poor filesystem performance.
Read more about [osxfs-caching](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/#performance-implications-of-host-container-file-system-consistency).

This project tries to store as much as possible on Docker VM.
The source code is still shared, thus it achieves suboptimal
performance due to significant overhead.

Running natively will achieve better performance, as there's simply no virtualization overhead.
This is not a case for Linux, as running in container allows to achieve 99.99% of the host performance.
